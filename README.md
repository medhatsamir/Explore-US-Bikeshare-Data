# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data

In this project, I will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Project Details
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

## The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

    Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
    End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
    Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
    Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
    End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
    User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
    The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

    Gender
    Birth Year

The original files are much larger and messier, and you don't need to download them, but they can be accessed here if you'd like to see them ([Chicago](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data), [New York City](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data), [Washington](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)). These files had more columns and they differed in format in many cases. Some data wrangling has been performed to condense these files to the above core six columns.

## Udacity data analyst Bikeshare data
This project explores Bike share data from 3 differents cities; it uses data from csv files to compute staticts from those 3 cities, also takes user inputs to create an interactive experience.

## Built with
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Pycharm (IDE)

## Files used
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
